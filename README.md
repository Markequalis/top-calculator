# The Odin Project Calculator

This calculator was a very difficult challenge for me. I spent many, many hours reworking the code based on how I wanted this to come out and spent lots of hours troubleshooting non-issues. I don't have many pushes/pulls on this because I kept reworking it.

# Calculator Functionality

The calculator functions almost perfectly for the most part, but it has issues with long strings of numbers. Think "111111111111 - 1"; it turns into 111111111112 for some reason and none of the operators work well with it. 

Also less of an issue but still one: the +/i symbol is an operator. If you're trying to do 7 * -2, because of how the calculator works you will need to type 7 * 2 first and then it'll evaluate the equation as though it was -2. It also seems to think that -7 - (-2) is still a subtraction, so... yeah. 

Otherwise, the functionality is fine. It has keyboard functionality as well.
